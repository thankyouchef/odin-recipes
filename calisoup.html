    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups Whole Milk</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Head of Cauliflower</li>
        <li>2 Carrots</li>
        <li>2 Celery Stalks</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>3TBS Butter</li>
        <li>3 TBS Flour</li>
        <li>8 oz Sharp Cheedar Cheese (in a block)</li>
        <li>Andouille Sausage</li>
        <li>2.5 Cups Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>Kale</li>
        <li>Tobasco (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your ingredients, pour the milk into a measuring cup,
            chop your cauliflower into florets, slice your carrots into medallions
            chop chelery, finely shop your onion, grate your cheddar cheese,
            slice the andouille, chop the kale.
            (A not about the cheese. You <strong>must</strong> buy the cheese brick.
            Shredded cheese is coated so it doesn't stick together and will not melt properly in the roux.</li>
        <li>In your soup pot combine: oil, carrot, celery, onion, and cauliflower
            sautee for a few minutes, then add your chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer until vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>In a different saucepan, melt the butter, stir in flour and salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk in the milk. The roux will start to congeal,
             continue whisking and adding milk. This is normal</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil for a few minutes until it has thickened
            then stir in your cheese until it is melted.</li>
        <li>Stir your roux/cheese mixture into your cauliflower mixture until combined.</li>
        <li>If you have a blender, I usaully take about 2.5 cups of the soup
            and puree it, and add it back to the soup. This makes it super creamy, while still
            keeping some whole cauliflower in there</li>
        <li>Add the andoullie sausage, let it come to temp, and hten add the kale (so it doesn't wilt too much)</li>
        <li>Fini! Serve and Eat!</li>
    </ol>
