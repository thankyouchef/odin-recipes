    <p>This is the first recipe I ever learned how to make! It's wicked easy 
    (as long as you have a cast iron skillet) and is exceptional leftover. 
    I usually make it at the start of the work wee kand have a slice for
    breakfast every day.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Eggs</li>
        <li>Handful of cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>feta cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs of your choosing</li>
        <li>1 Potato</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 can Northern or Black Beans</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in the skillet</li>
        <li>Slice the potato into medallions about 1/4" thick</li>
        <li>Arrange the potatoes on the bottom of the skillet to cover the surface</li>
        <li>While you're waiting, quarter your tomatoes and drain and rinse your beans</li>
        <li>Flip your potato medallions and salt and pepper them </li>
        <li>Whisk your eggs in a separate bowl</li>
        <li>Add your beans, and half of your herbs to the skillet and sautee lightly</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs in the skillet and cover</li>
        <li>After the middle of the frittata has started to set, add the tomatoes, herbs and feta cheese to the top</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the feta on top, and put your oven on the 'broil' setting</li>
        <li>Move the cast iron into the oven under the broiler. You want the top of the frittata to cook, and veggies to wilt a ltitle.</li>
        <li>Remove, and let sit before dividing it up between your friends :)</li>
    </ol>
